I've completed the research discussion and saved RESEARCH_DISCUSSION7.md. Here's a summary of what was explored:

## Summary of Research Discussion 7

The discussion with Codex covered several critical threads building on Discussions 1-6:

### Key Conclusions

1. **Why Phase 0 Failed But Phase 1 Succeeded**: The core insight is that **language has categorical structure that survives coarsening, while audio has continuous structure that doesn't**. This explains why Engram-style discrete lookup works for language but fails for continuous audio latents. The solution is "memory-as-basis" (soft retrieval over prototypes) rather than hard lookup.

2. **The Teacher-Forced vs Rollout Gap**: The 45-nat gap (98% lost) is partially fundamental (covariate shift is exponential) but partially addressable. The 450x magnitude shrinkage indicates the model learned "predict zero is the Nash equilibrium under accumulated error." Realistic goal: recover 10-15 nats, not all 45.

3. **vMF Factorization Rationale**: The key insight is enabling "slow but correctly directed" trajectories (Mode B) rather than stationary predictions (Mode A) or fast-but-wrong (Mode C). If perceptual quality correlates more with direction than magnitude, this is a meaningful improvement.

4. **Magnitude Generative Story**: Four options evaluated. Recommend starting with Option B (magnitude conditioned on direction), escalating to Option C (prosody-conditioned) if needed.

5. **Relationship to CALM**: Our work is complementary, not replacement. The natural synthesis is "vMF-factored CALM" combining explicit uncertainty factorization with CALM's noise injection and consistency modeling.

6. **Honest Paper Framing**: "Factorized Uncertainty Modeling for Continuous Autoregressive Audio" - a general contribution about direction/magnitude decomposition rather than an Engram-for-audio claim.

### Experimental Roadmap

- **This Week**: Teacher-forcing injection diagnostic (Modes A-D), cosine vs L2 tracking, MDN component analysis
- **Next Week**: vMF factorization + rollout training, listen to outputs
- **Week 3**: Direction archetype discovery (if vMF succeeds)
- **Week 4**: Memory integration (if archetypes exist)

The document is saved at `./RESEARCH_DISCUSSION7.md` with detailed analysis, probability estimates, implementation code in appendices, and clear stopping conditions for each experimental phase.
