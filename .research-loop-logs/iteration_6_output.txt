I've completed the research discussion with Codex and saved the structured document as `RESEARCH_DISCUSSION6.md`. Here's a summary of what was covered:

## Key Findings from Discussion 6

**1. Diagnosis over Architecture**
The most important insight is that the teacher-forced vs rollout gap (-35 vs -1 ΔNLL) is primarily an **objective mismatch problem**, not a representation problem. The model learns "do nothing" because that minimizes cumulative loss under covariate shift. Diagnostic experiments should precede architectural changes.

**2. Two High-Priority Experiments Identified**
- **Teacher-forcing injection experiment**: Run rollout but periodically inject ground-truth states (Modes A-D). This reveals whether the problem is per-step error, cumulative drift, or distribution shift. Takes <1 hour.
- **K=1 behavior comparison**: Compare teacher-forcing-trained vs rollout-trained models under teacher-forcing evaluation to determine if the model learned a global conservative prior.

**3. vMF Factorization - Nuanced Assessment**
vMF may help, but not for the reasons initially proposed. The value is enabling "slow but correctly directed" trajectories that preserve directional information while hedging on magnitude. However, Codex is more pessimistic than me on whether this breaks the conservatism feedback loop (0.15 vs 0.25 probability).

**4. Memory-as-Basis is Not Really Engram**
The continuous-key / soft-retrieval mechanism is fundamentally different from discrete lookup. The honest framing should be "learned direction codebook for continuous dynamics" rather than "Engram for audio."

**5. Recommended Paper Framing**
"Continuous AR audio needs explicit uncertainty factorization" - some aspects of audio dynamics are categorical (transition type), some are continuous (transition intensity), and conflating them hurts. This is a general contribution that survives even if memory doesn't work.

**6. Experimental Roadmap**
1. Diagnostic phase first (teacher-forcing injection, cosine vs L2 tracking)
2. vMF as drop-in for Phase 1 if diagnostics support
3. Direction archetype extraction
4. Memory-as-basis only if archetypes are validated

The document includes implementation notes, probability estimates, and fallback plans for negative results.
